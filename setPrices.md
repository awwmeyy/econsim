**Task:** Generate initial market prices for all goods and resources based on the provided country schemas and their industries.

---

**Instructions:**

1. **Input Data:**

   - You will be given detailed schemas for all countries, including:
     - **Industries** with their inputs and outputs.
     - **Stockpiles** of goods and resources.
     - **Natural Resources** available for extraction.
   - **Note:** Use only the provided data for your calculations.

2. **Objective:**

   - Calculate the initial market price for each good and resource in the game.
   - Prices should reflect a balanced market considering supply and demand.

3. **Factors to Consider:**

   - **Supply:**
     - Total quantity of each good available across all countries (including stockpiles and production outputs).
   - **Demand:**
     - Total quantity of each good required as inputs by industries across all countries.
   - **Scarcity and Abundance:**
     - Goods with high demand and low supply should have higher prices.
     - Goods with low demand and high supply should have lower prices.
   - **Production Complexity:**
     - Consider the complexity and technology level required to produce the good.
     - Goods requiring advanced technology or multiple inputs may have higher base prices.
   - **Economic Principles:**
     - Use basic economic models to ensure prices make sense within the game's economy.
     - Aim for prices that allow for fair trade between countries.

4. **Output Format:**
   - Provide the prices in a structured JSON format as shown below.
   - **Do not** include any additional text or explanations.

```json
{
  "Prices": {
    "Good1": price_in_numeric_value,
    "Good2": price_in_numeric_value,
    "...": "..."
  }
}
```

**Example:**

```json
{
  "Prices": {
    "Copper Ore": 50,
    "Electronics": 200,
    "Silicon": 80
  }
}
```

5. **Guidelines:**
   - All prices should be positive numeric values.
   - Round prices to the nearest whole number for simplicity.
   - Ensure consistency in pricing relative to the goods' importance and availability.
   - Verify that the calculated prices align logically with the supply and demand data.

**Note:** Focus on creating a realistic and balanced pricing model that will serve as the foundation for the game's economy. Your calculations should facilitate engaging trade dynamics and strategic decision-making for players.
