**Task:** Determine the **Quantity Threshold (X)** for price adjustments and maximum transactions per turn, as well as the **Maximum Price (Price Ceiling)** and **Minimum Price (Price Floor)** for each resource in the marketplace, based on resource rarity and availability.

---

### **Instructions:**

1. **Input Data:**
   - **Schemas:**
     - You are provided with detailed schemas for all countries, which include:
       - **Industries** with their inputs and outputs.
       - **Stockpiles** of goods and resources.
       - **Natural Resources** available for extraction, including total reserves and extraction rates.
       - **Workforce** details.
   - **Market Prices:**
     - You have the initial market prices for each resource and good.

2. **Objective:**
   - For **each resource and good** in the marketplace, determine the following:
     - **Quantity Threshold (X):**
       - The quantity of units that triggers a **5% price adjustment**.
       - Also serves as the **maximum transaction amount per turn** for that resource.
     - **Maximum Price (Price Ceiling):**
       - The highest allowable price for the resource.
     - **Minimum Price (Price Floor):**
       - The lowest allowable price for the resource.

3. **Factors to Consider:**

   **a. Resource Rarity and Availability:**

   - **Total Reserves:**
     - Sum the total reserves of each resource across all countries.
   - **Extraction Rates:**
     - Aggregate the maximum extraction rates per turn for each resource.
   - **Supply:**
     - Consider current stockpiles and production outputs.
   - **Demand:**
     - Calculate the total demand for each resource based on industry inputs across all countries.
   - **Scarcity Index:**
     - Compute a scarcity score for each resource:
       - **Scarcity Index = Demand / (Supply + Extraction Rate)**
       - A higher index indicates greater scarcity.

   **b. Resource Importance:**

   - **Strategic Value:**
     - Assess the importance of the resource in key industries and overall economic development.
   - **Production Complexity:**
     - Consider the technology level and inputs required to produce the resource.
   - **Dependency:**
     - Resources that are critical and have few or no substitutes should be considered more important.

   **c. Economic Balance:**

   - **Market Stability:**
     - Ensure the determined values promote a stable and fair market.
   - **Preventing Market Manipulation:**
     - Set transaction limits to prevent players from drastically influencing prices in a single turn.

4. **Calculations and Guidelines:**

   **a. Quantity Threshold (X):**

   - **Determining X:**
     - For each resource, set **X** inversely proportional to its scarcity:
       - **Lower X for Scarce Resources:** Scarcer resources should have a smaller **X** to make prices more sensitive to transactions.
       - **Higher X for Abundant Resources:** More abundant resources can have a larger **X**.
   - **Formula to Calculate X (Example):**
     - **X = Base Value Ã— (1 / Scarcity Index)**
     - **Base Value:** You can use a standard base value (e.g., 100 units) adjusted as needed.

   **b. Maximum and Minimum Prices:**

   - **Price Ceiling (Max Price):**
     - Set as a multiple of the initial price, adjusted for scarcity and importance.
     - **Suggested Range:** 150% to 300% of the initial price.
     - **Scarce and Important Resources:** Higher multiple.
   - **Price Floor (Min Price):**
     - Set as a fraction of the initial price.
     - **Suggested Range:** 50% to 75% of the initial price.
     - **Abundant Resources:** Lower fraction.

   **c. Rounding and Limits:**

   - **Rounding:**
     - Round all values to the nearest whole number.
   - **Positive Values:**
     - Ensure all calculated values are positive numbers.

5. **Output Format:**

   - Provide the results in a structured JSON format as shown below.
   - **Do not** include any additional text or explanations.

   ```json
   {
     "Resources": {
       "Resource1": {
         "QuantityThreshold": X_value,
         "MaxTransactionPerTurn": X_value,
         "MaxPrice": max_price_value,
         "MinPrice": min_price_value
       },
       "Resource2": {
         "QuantityThreshold": X_value,
         "MaxTransactionPerTurn": X_value,
         "MaxPrice": max_price_value,
         "MinPrice": min_price_value
       },
       "..."
     }
   }
   ```

   **Example:**

   ```json
   {
     "Resources": {
       "Copper Ore": {
         "QuantityThreshold": 80,
         "MaxTransactionPerTurn": 80,
         "MaxPrice": 120,
         "MinPrice": 30
       },
       "Electronics": {
         "QuantityThreshold": 50,
         "MaxTransactionPerTurn": 50,
         "MaxPrice": 500,
         "MinPrice": 250
       },
       "Silicon": {
         "QuantityThreshold": 100,
         "MaxTransactionPerTurn": 100,
         "MaxPrice": 160,
         "MinPrice": 40
       }
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Guidelines:**

   - **Consistency and Logic:**
     - Ensure the values are logically consistent with the scarcity and importance of each resource.
   - **Verification:**
     - Cross-check that the Quantity Thresholds, Max Prices, and Min Prices make sense relative to each other.
   - **Avoid Extreme Values:**
     - Prevent setting values that are too restrictive or too lenient, which could unbalance the game.
   - **Uniform Application:**
     - Apply the same methodology across all resources for fairness.

---

### **Notes:**

- **Focus on Realism:**
  - Aim to create values that simulate a realistic economic environment within the game.
- **Enhancing Gameplay:**
  - The determined values should encourage strategic planning and meaningful interactions between players.
- **Dynamic Interactions:**
  - Remember that these values will interact with the dynamic pricing mechanism already established, where prices adjust by 5% per Quantity Threshold of transactions.

---

### **Additional Considerations:**

- **Scarcity Index Adjustments:**
  - You may normalize the Scarcity Index to ensure it provides usable values for calculations.
- **Resource Categorization:**
  - If helpful, categorize resources into tiers (e.g., Common, Uncommon, Rare) to guide the setting of values.
- **Flexibility:**
  - While guidelines are provided, use discretion to adjust values to best fit the overall balance and enjoyment of the game.

---

### **Assumptions:**

- **Price Adjustment Percentage:**
  - The price adjustment per Quantity Threshold remains at 5%.
- **Uniform Transaction Limits:**
  - The Max Transaction Per Turn is equal to the Quantity Threshold for simplicity.
